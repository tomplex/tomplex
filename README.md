### howdy

I'm tom. I'm a software engineer primarily focused on working with all kinds of data. I am competent in several programming languages, but Python remains my favorite. I have worked on all technical aspects of software projects from design to deploy.

I love to make things, be it a tasty dinner, a loaf of bread, a hardwood stool, or an api server. 

I currently work at [Faraday](https://faraday.ai/), where we build developer tools for responsible AI.
