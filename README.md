### howdy

I'm tom. I'm a software engineer primarily focused on working with all kinds of data. I am competent in several programming languages, but Python remains my favorite. I pride myself on being a jack of all trades and as such I have worked on all technical aspects of software projects from design to deploy. 

I love to make things regardless of the medium, be it dough, wood, or code. 

I currently work at [Faraday](https://faraday.ai/), where we build developer tools for responsible AI.
